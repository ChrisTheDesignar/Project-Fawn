## TL;DR
posts, reels, groups, open source projects, research papers, and more, all referenced in a categorized easy to view format

This is a running and evolving list. I just reformatted everything in this "research card" style format, so that all these links can be displayed and explored more easily, and to attach to specific drawings and upcoming posts. The most relevant and applicable posts are likely to be the research papers which have informed my direction. There is a lot to read through and digest here!
