## TL;DR
I built a simple scanning ramp that defines and captures a skier’s stance under load. Adjustable geometry locks in stance parameters, while heat-softened PLA foot forms collapse to record true weight-bearing foot contact. The result is a fixed physical reference for downstream 3D scanning and modeling.
