Without this critical detail, they could really only exist as vague ideas, not solidified visions. I explored all sorts of surrounding solutions, and just kept not seeing what was needed to close this loop.\r\n\r\nI had the thought of the paneled construction and figured I could test that idea further. I created a sample geometry of 8 triangular polygons to manually test modeling them. The process worked and it was straightforward but tedious to intersect and define all the mated edges. I 3D printed two sample tiles sets, both with the flexible TPU layers printed directly over top of the hard PETG tiles. With the green and black padded ones (dual densities) I tried folding thin connecting edges and bonding them with West Systems G-Flex epoxy. On the white and orange test, I used a 3d pen to weld the seams together. This was a better solution as it was more accommodating of minor dimensional misalignments. However, I had to clear the padding elements on the interior to have clearance for the 3d pen. It also, obviously, leaves a large visible weld line that is far from ideal. In addition, folding even a thin layer or two did not really work as the extrusion lines tended to break apart.  \r\n\r\nThese two prototypes clearly showed that the build process could create the geometry and the padding prints bonded without issue. They also showed that a procedural process for defining the mesh and refining the edge seams was critical, as was finding a means of joining them together to create a reliable load bearing structure. \r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={GlueWeld.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={GlueWeld}\r\n    alt=\"previous explorations with joining printed tiles via 3d pen welding and epoxy bonding\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\nFor a long time, I imagined that the tiles could utilize complex printed 3D dovetail features to mechanically join the tiles to each other. I figure with some work it would be feasible to create a process to automatically create these dovetails based on the assembly/pull direction they would need assembled in. That seemed feasible, but it didn't account for any way to keep them joined together, and even worse, there was no clear path to making that idea something you could easily put on, take off, and latch together.  \r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={threeDdovetail.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={threeDdovetail}\r\n    alt=\"example model showing 1 edge of a tile with a interlocking 3D shaped dovetail\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\nMy good friend AJ at Lucid Drums specializes in repairing traditional african drums. I was looking at the tension lines that were all interwoven and the way it all just felt so taught and springy and durable, it got me thinking seriously about lacing a boot up in a similar fashion. Looking at my angular low poly boot concepts, it seemed feasible to string together the tiles somehow, but this seemed complex as routing the rope between all the tiles might leave some unstrung or create tight bends that would cause too much friction. But just maybe there was something to that idea. \r\n\r\nAround the same time I was chewing all that over, I came across a post on facebook with a spiral cut orange peel unwrapping to appear like the familiar \"f hole\" shape you see in violins and other musical instruments. I went and cut myself and orange that way and had an ahh ha moment. A foot in a ski boot and this orange could both utilize the same spiral unwrapping approach to flatten the 3D surface in a way that a tension line could route through efficiently.  \r\n\r\nOne decision I had been thinking over, is once the ski boot shell geometry is obtained and you have that low poly exterior, you could build each tile off each flat face, OR you could potentially create a more complex \"node\" tile that further broke down that low poly shape with intermeshing geometries so that the load bearing edges of the mesh were individual tiles and not seams? The idea of the mesh geometry vs the tile prints having an offset element to them was interesting as well; they don't HAVE to line up with each other.\r\n\r\nimage of simple tile vs node tile\r\n\r\nThrough all of this, things started to come together. I thought of a chinese finger trap toy and the mechanism that it uses to tighten; Inter woven biaxial tube braiding. This was essentially the process from my orange peel experiment, but executed in opposing directions to divide the surface further. \r\n\r\nimage Cut an orange this way\r\n\r\nThis biaxial weaving is the same process used to make the colorful jackets of paracord rope. So then I thought, if this tube braid could be appropriately deformed and routed around the heel and forefoot, that could be a path to close this boot. Upon thinking about it more, this started to look very intriguing. The boot could potentially be loosely held together like a chainmail and could be simply slipped on to the foot loosely, then tensioned (via some means) so that the tiles were pulled together. I found that this is an emerging field of technology referred to as meta bead structures, and indeed, they can, when correctly designed, create stiffness-tunable structures that can carry extreme loads upon entering a \"super-jammed\" state. Now that just SOUNDS cool, and there was research to support digging into this path, so I started going forward with it. \r\n\r\nI chewed these ideas over for a long time while setting up this site before finally taking the time to sit with my iPad and draw. First, I took a previous ski sock foot sketch I had with a good angle, and had chatgpt kick me out a photorealistic ski sock wearing foot to draw over, because the original sketch wasn't amazing and I didn't want to redraw it. I then sketched out construction planes to bend the braid path around the heel and forefoot, and approximated the circumference of the boot at those points. I split those into 8 segments, and connected the vertexes with the next adjacent one on the following layer. This laid out my spiraling cord network. I then saw clearly that with this type of cord path my tiles would be likely based on 4 inputs of the cord paths, not the three sides of the triangle. I assigned the crossover point as the center of each tile, and ended up with an 8 sided tile (avoids sharp corners) that rides on two roughly perpendicular tension cords. Inter spaced with those would exist the secondary TPU/TPE printed liner parts. These offset, flexible parts could act to help seal and or hold the boot tiles together via clever featuring and account for expansion/contraction and frictional wear and noise. \r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={beigebootprocess.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={beigebootprocess}\r\n    alt=\"example model showing 1 edge of a tile with a interlocking 3D shaped dovetail\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\nThe next element I wanted to at least visualize here was the concept of the break-away heel lug. Since my insight that the binding should not need to be reinvented since it can't distinguish between normal ski forces and phantom-foot forces, I figured the boot should contain a release modality of its own. For one, the boot is a much more feasible device to detect and distinguish between safe and compromised body positions, but also I don't want to try to replace all the bindings that are out there; that's not feasible or ecological. By building the release into the boot, it means any ski that the user decides to ski or demo can be skied confidently knowing the release mechanism has been baked into the boots. \r\n\r\nSo how would that all work? Well I don't know yet, but showing something is how we get the idea rolling. My initial thoughts are that these tension paths could be further refined to align more precisely with a user's anatomy so that when one is leaning back and to the side, certain cord paths could load and unload in such a way that they could \"slip\" into an over center state that would allow the heel ejection to be able to occur. Only Once that mechanical (or electronic) logic gate was opened, could the heel release be available. It might simply break away or require a spring loaded element like a ski binging uses, but the main point shown is the boot is determining the compromised biomechanical position and only allowing the release to happen in those states. This should prevent this function from limiting skiing performance. Its feasible that this setup might similarly tighten that heel interface under aggressive skiing to ensure that unwanted movement is prevented.  \r\n\r\nAs I was building out the sketch, I could see it was possible to loop opposite strand paths over at the toe so that the effective number of tension cords could be halved. This still left a bunch of literal loose ends to deal with, but I kept sketching the boot anyway. I figured tensioning the whole thing was a different problem to solve. \r\n\r\nI explored a few different ideas for closing the boot via tensioning the laces. On the most low end, they could be tied off with knots. this would function for a prototype but not for a product. Maybe a gathered bundle of tension cords making up a neux powerstrap? Maybe they are electronically activated spool tensioners? Sure. Lets roll with that for this concept just 'cause. We'll figure it out for real as we go! \r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={beigehero.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={beigehero}\r\n    alt=\"project fawn concept ski boot by CTD with modular braided tiles\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\nAt this point I wanted to keep finessing the drawing, but decided it got the points I wanted to convey across. I started feeding the sketch into Chatgpt and Gemini with similarly disappointing results at improving the realism. they kept turning them into hiking boots. What did almost work was a process where I made an image of a skier putting the boot on, and then overlaid it with the sketch and fed it into wan2.5 and Veo3. The Wan 2.5 result was generated on Artlist.io as trial and while the boot still turns into a hiking boot, it does an impressive job of visualizing the lacing changing the boots stiffness for putting it on. The Google result had convincing 3D printed textures but the forms deviated back to more of a traditional pivoting ski boot design. The added voiceover was auto generated and of course the boot breaks down into slop when it is tensioned, but still fun to look at these only partially successful results. \r\n\r\nAI images\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 items-start\">\r\n  \u003CEmbed type=\"youtube\" id=\"EuLYiSWgcS0\" title=\"AI animated ski boot concept\" />\r\n  \u003CEmbed type=\"youtube\" id=\"y5k3ZdtxX7c\" title=\"Ski boot concept sketch animation\" />\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the wan2.5 result starts, there is a few seconds of my sketch deforming around in a surprisingly convincingly way.

first post on this website. It, ironically, has little to do with ski boots, but equally with technology making it possible. This website was created and deployed by me, Chris Trunek, someone whose only website building experience has been through website builders like Squarespace and Wix. My background and expertise lies in design and user experience, so this is a jump for me, but one I have deemed required to make this site \"ground up\". I have been using ChatGPT to guide me through all of the steps required to get this basic framework online, and until this point, it has been both exciting and frustrating, obtaining the minimal lightweight aesthetic and function I wanted to build on, but hitting constant roadblocks and looping errors. Today I was able to try out ChatGPT 5 and it was able to get the code sorted and we now have this deployment! While this site is currently about as low tech as possible, building the vessel to contain my thoughts on this subject, and making that real are very exciting! So now that the most basic form of the site is live, I have to figure out how to structure these posts and start adding the backlog of content that exists so that I can start moving this idea forward.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={atTheHelm.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={atTheHelm}\r\n    alt=\"At the helm\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we go!

I then started selling equipment and skiing for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.aspenskiandboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Aspen Ski and Board\u003C/a>{\" \"}while studying industrial design at The Ohio State University, where I conceptualized a Line Reactor–inspired, knee-safe, freestyle-focused ski binding system for my \u003Ca href=\"https://www.christrunekdesign.com/thesis-binding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">thesis\u003C/a>{\" \"}after blowing out my own knee on a bio 720 that drifted off line into the icy chunder lining the landing of another early Ohio terrain park. While finalizing my degree, I began working as an industrial designer at \u003Ca href=\"https://tridentinvents.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Trident Design\u003C/a>, where I did a great deal of concept sketching, 3D modeling and rendering, patent research, and frequent work with early industrial 3D-printed prototypes.\r\n\r\nUpon graduating I left for Utah and worked remotely for Trident while skiing every day, clocking afternoon design shifts between the epic powder days of the 2010–2011 season.\r\n\r\nEventually that arrangement stopped making sense, and I began working at \u003Ca href=\"https://www.jans.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Jans Mountain Outfitters\u003C/a>{\" \"} in Park City, where I learned a great deal about ski-boot fitting, binding testing, and setup. I had been building \u003Ca href=\"https://www.christrunekdesign.com/copy-2-of-skis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">custom longboard skateboards\u003C/a>{\" \"} since middle school, and I transitioned that hobby into \u003Ca href=\"https://www.christrunekdesign.com/copy-of-skis-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">ski building\u003C/a>{\" \"}while working at Jans’ tuning center, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.jans.com/rennstall-ski-tuning?srsltid=AfmBOoollP1fhhfKJ8aIlmUgagwOOkMfAJdtfMEVFMtKXW0Q_Bwp7CEA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Rennstall \u003C/a>{\" \"}, at the base of Park City Resort. There I learned the ins and outs of ski tuning, and most importantly I could properly finish and tune the skis I was building, running them after hours through the grinding machines required to refine base and edges from their raw molded finish.\r\n\r\nThat ski-building endeavor led to early involvement in the founding of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.vishnufreeski.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Vishnu Skis\u003C/a>{\" \"} with Emmett Davis and Kale Cipperman. after parting ways I went on to work at \u003Ca href=\"https://www.modaliti.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Modaliti Design\u003C/a>{\" \"} where I assisted on product designs for, among others, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.surefoot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Surefoot Ski Boots\u003C/a>. Later—and more permanently, I went on to start \u003Ca href=\"https://www.daymakertouring.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Daymaker Touring\u003C/a>{\" \"} alongside Giray Dadali, where we’ve helped thousands of people around the world get uphill on their favorite skis.\r\n\r\nThrough all of this, a pattern kept nagging me. Compared to other activities, skiing seems to be challenged by three stubborn friction points:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={xRayKnee.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={xRayKnee}\r\n    alt=\"An x-ray from what would be my second knee surgery\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n## Safety\r\nSkiing is dangerous. Unlike many other active and potentially dangerous pursuits, skiers are uniquely plagued by persistent injuries caused by being bound to the skis. Everyone knows that if you ski, there’s a good chance you might eventually blow a knee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={redSnakeTraffic.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={redSnakeTraffic}\r\n    alt=\"a chatGPT generated image of traffic hell getting to the mountain\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n## Accessibility\r\n\r\nGoing skiing is time-consuming and stressful unless you can be all-in and wrap your lifestyle around it. Getting proper equipment is difficult, and if you get it wrong, it takes lots of trial and error to correct. All of this is expensive, and when you already have a million other things to do, the barriers stack up—and you don’t ski.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={coldBoots.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={coldBoots}\r\n    alt=\"chatGPT generated image highlighting how ill fitting ski boots result in poor circulation\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n## Ski Boots\r\nGiven the above—and how difficult it is to get properly fitted in the “right” boot—ski boots are a big downside for many people. Worse, ill-fitted boots contribute to another common problem: cold feet.\r\n\r\nThese pain points slowly became clear to me over the years and have always bothered me. Through Daymaker Touring, we’ve done a lot to address them, but I knew there was much more that could be done.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, I had been 3D printing a wide variety of parts on various platforms and processes through my work as an industrial designer outside the ski industry. While I’ve worked with many advanced prototyping methods, what really excites me is the accessibility of fused deposition modeling (FDM), the technology common in low-cost desktop printers. Designing parts specifically tuned to the strengths and weaknesses of this process has proven fertile ground for innovation, and it started to occur to me that a 3D-printed ski boot might be genuinely feasible if approached properly.\r\n\r\n## A FIRST-PRINCIPLES BOOT\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv className=\"hscroll\" aria-roledescription=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"First principles boots\">\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow left\"  type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Previous image\" />\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow right\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Next image\" />\r\n\r\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"track\" tabIndex={0}>\r\n    {[\r\n      [skiTouringOnDaymakerPrototypes, 'Chris Trunek, Giray Dadali and Alec Finke of Daymaker Touring ski touring on 3D printed prototype parts'],\r\n      [bailKeepers, 'Batch production of Bail Keeper parts'],\r\n      [daymakerBslJig, 'A 3D printed tool to replicate boot sole lengths and check binding fit'],\r\n    ].map(([src, caption], i) => (\r\n      \u003Cfigure className=\"item\" key={i}>\r\n        \u003Ca href={src.src} className=\"full\" data-caption={caption}>\r\n          \u003Cimg src={src.src} alt={caption} loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n        \u003C/a>\r\n        \u003Cfigcaption>{caption}\u003C/figcaption>\r\n      \u003C/figure>\r\n    ))}\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Daymaker side we’d already ski-toured on plenty of 3D-printed prototypes, we had produced roughly 10,000 production-grade NinjaFlex TPU “bail keepers” for the Daymaker Classic, and we relied day in and out on 3D printed setup tools that replicated an adjustable boot sole, so I knew the material reality wasn’t science fiction. Around 2018–2019 I started poking at the idea of a fully 3D-printed boot. What I found indicated that the surface had been scratched, but most examples didn’t feel like new directions in performance boot design— but more like tech demos for the prototyping industry.\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv className=\"hscroll\" aria-roledescription=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"2019 3D Printed Ski Boot Research\">\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow left\"  type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Previous image\" />\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow right\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Next image\" />\r\n\r\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"track\" tabIndex={0}>\r\n    {[\r\n      [ri6, 'Industrially printed ski boot shells'],\r\n      [ri4, 'one piece TPU liner concepts by Tailored Fits'],\r\n      [ri1, 'Open source pipelines to create custom orthodic insoles using flexible filaments'],\r\n      [ri2, '3D printed cast concepts'],\r\n      [ri3, 'copslay armor boots created with desktop 3D printer'],\r\n      [ri5, 'photogrametry pipeline allows any camera to capture high quality 3d scan data'],\r\n      [ri7, 'Flexible tpu shoes'],\r\n      [ri8, 'Intricate aesthetic posiblities of 3D printing are demonstrated in this high heel'],\r\n      [ri9, 'Desktop FDM printing is inexpensive'],\r\n          ].map(([src, caption], i) => (\r\n      \u003Cfigure className=\"item\" key={i}>\r\n        \u003Ca href={src.src} className=\"full\" data-caption={caption}>\r\n          \u003Cimg src={src.src} alt={caption} loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n        \u003C/a>\r\n        \u003Cfigcaption>{caption}\u003C/figcaption>\r\n      \u003C/figure>\r\n    ))}\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\nOn a long flight back from Japan, I came prepared with colored paper, pencils, a soundtrack, and a question: What would a 3D-printed boot look like?\r\n\r\nTwo and three-piece ski boot shells are the way they are because of how they are made. Injection molding imposes specific constraints that echo through their design and the experience of using them. Modern ski boots have gotten quite good— amazing, actually. But the generalist nature of the manufacturing process means no ski boot is truly fit to an individual’s foot in its entirety, and if we’re honest, the ritual of cramming your foot in and out of performance shells isn’t very fun. A custom footbed helps enormously, and boot punching and grinding can eliminate hot spots while keeping a snug, secure fit, but the reality is this level of customization is difficult to achieve and the results are highly dependent on the bootfitter’s skill.\r\n\r\nAdditive manufacturing, on the other hand, provides a very different rulebook for part design with the potential to radically reshape what a ski boot even is. With that in mind I took my first stab at sketching what a 3D-printed boot might look like.\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv className=\"hscroll\" aria-roledescription=\"carousel\" aria-label=\"Blue Boot Sketches\">\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow left\"  type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Previous image\" />\r\n  \u003Cbutton className=\"arrow right\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Next image\" />\r\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"track\" tabIndex={0}>\r\n    {[\r\n      [img1, 'Sketched on a plane from Japan with colored pencil and neon paper, this was a first take at exploring what a 3D printed boot might be'],\r\n      [img2, 'Patterned geometry in the interior of the boot'],\r\n      [img3, 'Laces? How do those work?'],\r\n      [img4, 'Printing layout for slicing the dual material print'],\r\n      [img5, 'Layer alignment of the boot heel'],\r\n      [img6, 'The boot is printed in segments which are joined, somehow, to each other'],\r\n    ].map(([src, caption], i) => (\r\n      \u003Cfigure className=\"item\" key={i}>\r\n        \u003Ca href={src.src} className=\"full\" data-caption={caption}>\r\n          \u003Cimg src={src.src} alt={caption} loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n        \u003C/a>\r\n        \u003Cfigcaption>{caption}\u003C/figcaption>\r\n      \u003C/figure>\r\n    ))}\r\n  \u003C/div>\r\n\u003C/div>\r\n\r\nIt quickly became clear that this had potential—but also huge hurdles. Printing the boot would allow total customization of the shell. Printed liners could be co-printed with the shell material; variable cushioning, ventilation, and circulation-boosting reliefs could be printed right into the part. With that potential, however, an obvious pitfall emerged: printing a boot shell that operates under enormous stress is not optimal. The size and geometric complexity make the print more prone to failure and, most importantly, issues inherent in FDM 3D printing make failure at the layer lines during use a highly probable—and potentially catastrophic—outcome.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the Cybertruck was revealed, and the low-poly aesthetic of its design was brutally on display. That influence, and a nostalgia and appreciation for early N64 and PlayStation graphics, had me wondering what that might look like applied to a ski boot. That “low-polygon count” aesthetic does work well for 3D-printed parts, as geometrically flat printed faces appear consistent, whereas curving faces can display irregularities due to Z-axis layer lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={greenLowPolyBoot.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={greenLowPolyBoot}\r\n    alt=\"Green low-poly boot sketch\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n\r\nI bashed out the next sketch on my iPad. I knew there was something there—but what exactly? This boot was built from two main 3D prints, opening to step in. The sharp geometric edges interlocking to tie the structure together, reminiscent of serrated parting lines in stealth-fighter design. I liked it and could see it was intriguing, but it was quick and low-res; there was still a lot to resolve.\r\n\r\nAnother thing quickly became evident: there was huge potential to innovate here, but doing so fully would require a broad range of expertise. I knew I had some of the skills required to tackle this endeavor, but leaning into other knowledge bases could really accelerate progress. I’ve seen how 3D printers have transformed from clunky and cumbersome to scary fast and capable through open, collaborative design. A customized 3D-printed ski boot seems well suited to that development model. If I can get the ball rolling with a pipeline to printable boots, that pipeline can be rapidly developed and improved by a whole host of participants from different backgrounds.\r\n\r\n## BUILD IT IN PUBLIC\r\n\r\nTo do this right, we need many disciplines to get excited about collaborating on this idea. Ski-industry veterans like shop owners, bootfitters, and legacy manufacturers have a huge amount of potential to contribute and participate. Equally exciting is integrating state of the art knowledge from a broad range of related fields. Add in feedback loops from real-world skiers and I think that this can become a North Star we can all work toward, so we each benefit uniquely while the sport benefits broadly. By addressing these problems head-on, I believe skiing can experience a surge in excitement, participation, and growth that people will want to be part of.\r\n\r\nA second, more personal goal with this approach is to flip my own workflow. Most of my best work has happened pre-launch, in stealth, because that’s how business as usual works. For Project Fawn, I want to try the opposite: open, public-facing development—product development as content. Comment-section suggestions driving implementation in real time. Secrecy and perfection rejected in favor of transparent, imperfect progression.\r\n\r\n## THE PLATFORM VISION\r\n\r\nThink of a web workflow that turns your biometrics into a digital last—stance, foot geometry, and performance goals—then compiles a printable boot file tuned to your precise biomechanics. This file is pure data, capable of being fabricated anywhere in the world, producible on a sliding scale of accessibility. I want this process to be followable with DIY open-source tools, printable on basic desktop machines, and capable of delivering strong performance at unheard-of costs. At the same time, I want to facilitate a workflow that allows professional service providers to handle any part of the pipeline so the boots can be obtained with minimal customer involvement and consistent quality.\r\n\r\n## WHY THE DEER?\r\n\r\nWhen this idea was percolating, a white fawn was spotted near our parents’ homes in rural Ohio. Across cultures, a white deer has been a prominent signal of change and rebirth. Sure enough, we welcomed our first child shortly after.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href={paperDeerStatue.src} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n  \u003CImage\r\n    src={paperDeerStatue}\r\n    alt=\"Papercraft Low Poly Fawn\"\r\n    sizes=\"(min-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw\"\r\n    style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\"\r\n  />\r\n\u003C/a>\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the new baby came the nursery décor, and the forest-deer motif became a theme. I built a \u003Ca href=\"https://paperzonevn.com/fawn-young-deer.t10017/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-[#A8FFB0] hover:underline\">Low Poly Fawn\u003C/a> from neon cardstock I had lying around from printing flyers. The build used a few different colored sheets; I figured it would be neat to visualize how it was paneled. \r\n\r\nOnce completed, holding the rigid paper sculpture and feeling how the whole thing flexed and snapped back into place instead of folding, the metaphors, signals, and concepts I had been picking up on all suddenly coalesced. Flat, thin pieces assembled geometrically into a large, complex 3D structure was the direction I would take.\r\n\r\nThat insight was key to addressing the classic 3D-printing headache mentioned earlier: the Z-axis problem, where the final part is consistently strong left-to-right and front-to-back, but prone to failure up and down. This occurs because interlayer bonds aren’t typically as strong as the extruded paths that make up the layers. On low-cost printers, various issues can amplify this, and simple design features can fail if not properly aligned.\r\n\r\nIf you think about a ski-boot shell and the forces it experiences during skiing, it’s easy to imagine how those Z-axis weaknesses could result in catastrophic failure if you simply tried to 3D print current two- or three-piece shell-wrapped boots.\r\n\r\nNow imagine the tessellated layout in the paper deer transposed to a ski boot: each tile can be printed so that almost all of the forces it experiences are in the part’s relative XY plane. A precision-crafted geometric edge could align the next tile, and this process repeats around the boot’s geometry to construct its entire structure from optimally aligned 3D-printed components. This tile approach creates the most 3D-printer-friendly geometry possible, and the exterior faces of the boot ends up being the most aesthetically pleasing first layer (with vast potential for customization we can explore). By breaking the part into smaller pieces, any printing or fit errors can be identified and replaced locally instead of scrapping the whole boot. What’s more, this approach allows even basic single-material printers to achieve dual-material functionality by stacking two different print files. Keeping the geometry smaller means faster prints on smaller, less expensive machines. The low-poly design language from that green Cybertruck sketch wasn’t just an aesthetic; it was a manufacturing strategy optimized for 3D printing.\r\n\r\n## WHERE THIS GOES NEXT?\r\n\r\nTo do this right, I knew I had to build Project Fawn as a container for this work. Without an interactive home, those ideas would just sit dormant in my archives. By building an online home— separate from social media limits and existing platforms, I can push these ideas to others who can also act on them.\r\n\r\nNo doubt I’ve been busy over the last few years, but the big thing limiting progress in this project for me was the knowledge gap required to bring a complex online project like this to life. I knew this wasn’t something that could live on a simple site-building platform, and that’s all I had experience with, so the idea sat.\r\n\r\nWith the development of artificial intelligenceo over the last few years, it’s now possible to make many of the ideas I’ve been dreaming about happen, and tools like ChatGPT have already helped me make considerable progress. The problems holding this project back are exactly the kinds of things AI excels at.\r\n\r\nAs I push this forward, I plan to begin by publishing blog-style content covering the backlog of ideas that still need to be presented properly. While there are many problems still to overcome, I’ve thought this process through much further than I’ve shown here.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I’ll be working on this site to add functionality and—once the back catalog is uploaded—start building this process in real time, working through failures and successes to bring the idea into reality. While this tile-based concept is the leading edge right now, it’s quite possible the process might steer the outcome in radically different directions, and that’s OK too.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get involved, have ideas to share, or just want to follow along, add your email to the interest list here and I’ll keep you in the loop until I build account functionality with commenting and posting. The goal is to host these conversations right here, on-platform, in real time.\r\n\r\nThat’s a wrap for this post. If you made it to the end you’re a champ. Thanks for taking the time to read about these ideas. I hope you’ll find this as exciting as I do, and that we can work to make it happen. It’d be great to be skiing early versions of these this winter.\r\n\r\nThank you, and stay tuned.\r\n\r\nChris","src/content/posts/what-is-this/what-is-this.mdx",[93],"./3d-printed-ski-boot-sketch.jpg","ca216676ca6ddbb6","what-is-this/what-is-this.mdx"]
