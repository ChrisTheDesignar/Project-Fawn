It, ironically, has little to do with ski boots, but equally with technology making it possible. This website was created and deployed by me, Chris Trunek, someone whose only website building experience has been through website builders like Squarespace and Wix. My background and expertise lies in design and user experience, so this is a jump for me, but one I have deemed required to make this site \"ground up\". I have been using ChatGPT to guide me through all of the steps required to get this basic framework online, and until this point, it has been both exciting and frustrating, obtaining the minimal lightweight aesthetic and function I wanted to build on, but hitting constant roadblocks and looping errors. Today I was able to try out ChatGPT 5 and it was able to get the code sorted and we now have this deployment! While this site is currently about as low tech as possible, building the vessel to contain my thoughts on this subject, and making that real are very exciting! So now that the most basic form of the site is live, I have to figure out how to structure these posts and start adding the backlog of content that exists so that I can start moving this idea forward.\r\n\r\nGiven that I am trying to work in a transparent and replicable manner, I feel it is necessary to attach the associated conversational thread responsible for getting to this point. To do this, my current thought is to screen record and scroll through the thread capturing all of the text as a video feed that, if slowed down or paused, can be read line by line. As I go forward I plan to keep building in this evolving manner, documenting the process, getting feedback, testing, and building.\r\n\r\nI also need to learn how to add image media to these posts. Currently I am hosting on Vercel free so not sure if internal external image hosting is ideal. Also, I assume the video I want to embed above will be from Youtube, not natively hosted? I need to figure this stuff out in this post.\r\n\r\nI also need to figure out how to format my markdown file, which is what this post is, so that it formats correctly both from the homepage and on the post's page.\r\n\r\nHere we go! I am going to screengrab this right here, post that screengrab to ChatGPT, and go from there!\r\n-Chris","src/content/posts/testing/testing.mdx",[23],"./testing.jpg","9b5b71f1434b3d01","testing/testing.mdx",true]
